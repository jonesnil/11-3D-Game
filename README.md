In this Godot first person platformer you play as a person who recently learned to fly. 
So far you can only really throw yourself in a direction. Move with WASD, jump with spacebar,
and press spacebar after jumping to launch yourself (press escape to quit). Look for the yellow 
arrows that point to the red exit points and try to beat the three levels! The last level is kind 
of hard.

For some reason in the second two levels the particle physics seem to make the crates turn black,
but the effect is cool enough I decided to keep it in. I think the only asset I used this time was
the crate and it was from here: https://kenney.nl/assets/platformer-kit
